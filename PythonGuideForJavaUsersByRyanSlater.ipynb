    "This guide is designed to be an introduction to the fundamentals of the Python language, with the basics of some useful modules as well. It is designed for programmers who know Java, with the intention of introducing imperative programming and the largely different syntax of Python. As you read through this guide, experiment by changing any lines of code as you wish, then press Shift+Enter to run that line alone. While this guide is fairly comprehensive, it does not cover all aspects of Python (which would frankly be quite near impossible anyways), so self-experimentation and discovery is essential. This guide is broken into many chapters, each of which focuses on a specific topic necessary to understanding the Python language. Some chapters are broken into sections to explain subtopics in more detail."

    "Java contains many numerical data types, such as ints, doubles, floats, shorts, and longs. In Python, this is not the case. There are simply ints and floats. Unlike Java, there is no max size for an either, meaning that an int or float can have a value near infinity. Note there is no need to begin a line by declaring a variable type, as Python automatically determines the variable type from the value assigned. Also note that Python syntax is based of indentation, (you will learn about indenting in chapter 3) so no semicolon is needed at the end of each line."
